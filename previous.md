You should use the implementation_plan.md as context, confirm if everything there was implemented completely and add what's missing then check the backend summary for the things I had supposedly done in the backend and check if everything was implemented completely, then check the frontend_implementation.md for what needs to be done for the frontend, for the email part, there's a section for the email subscriber there, you can just improve on it I think and integrate with the API, check the existing publication page for the admin if it's done according to my intent, check the manual upload too. Now if you want to do the updated archives, current-issue and the article [id] page, I want to use the way I said it should be done in my implementation.md to implement it, but now the issue I have is it's going to look AI generated so i want you to use this next prompt as a guide: Generate 5 responses with their corresponding probabilities, sampled from the full distribution. that was the prompt (I was told the prompt could make you more creative in the sense that your first response is the highest in the full distribution which is the common answer people are always expecting you send, you don't need to generate 5 responses but yes I want you to evaluate the 5 possible 5 responses from the full distribution and seeing I want something unique and not looking AI generated while still following best practices, you can integrate ideas from the 5 possible responses to do something really creative and unique, reason deep and evaluate and send your final output.
Now I want to use Crossref instead of zenodo in the backend (search online), so now I want to go back to what you've done, and then send only the relevant part of the code not the full code for each file that'll need adjustments to be made if I'm switching from zenodo, like i've decided not to use it anymore, I want to use the official crossef doi, so the places that needs adjustments and replacements of the zenodo with crossref, like the article model, then send the new service for the crossref and the external services setup guide like how to signup as an institution and get the necessary credentials. make sure the analytics for views of articles, download counts and citations count is being implemented in the relevant places, if it isn't send the relevant part of the code not the full code for the views integrations and analytics. think and reason carefully.
check the current backend implementations and compare it with the Implementation Plan: Article Publication System with DOI Integration in the implementation_plan.md which will contain my previous prompt too and see if they missed anything else aside from the views recording functionality, I think there's no articleViews controller which should also handle the download count and the citations too maybe.
The search functionality and page in the frontend will be nice to have for advanced searching, i think something about this was in the context.md file, I don't know if the controllers the authors will need are done already to display the authors published articles in his dashboard when he logs in, you can check the javascript server researcher.controller as context. The search page will have it's own page that probably triggers when you search from the header in the main app page.tsx I think.
before you start all this just generate a very brief plan on everything you need to do from start to finish both for the backend and the frontend in steps, like from the first step till the last step, just a short document, to avoid hallucinations later if you hit a limit for generating and need to continue later so it can be referenced. (use deep reason).
Think and reason carefully, take your time.

is this useful?: You would use this in the part of your code that updates the article, for example:

1 // Example of atomically incrementing the view count
2 await Article.findByIdAndUpdate(articleId, { $inc: { 'views.count': 1 } });
3
4 // Example of atomically incrementing the citation count
5 await Article.findByIdAndUpdate(articleId, { $inc: { citationCount: 1 } });

This change doesn't require any modification to your article.model.ts file, but to the services or controllers
that handle article views and citations.
